# VectorAdd
Using CUDA to add vectors
For running this particular programme we need to install numpy into your local dependency

Numba uses Python decorators to transform Python functions into functions that compile themselves. The most common Numba decorator is @jit, which creates a normal function for execution on the CPU.

Numba works best on numerical functions that make use of NumPy arrays.

This helps in the processing of the vectors.
